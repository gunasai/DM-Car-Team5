# DM-Car-Team5

The main purpose of this project is to become familiar with data mining techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and to apply them to real world problems, i.e., autonomous vehicle.

## Suggestions

1.  Train the car to calibrate the position of the car to the initial position in the beginning
2.  Train the car to understand different types of images with the same meaning
3.  The material with which the car has been assembled in very weak. A stronger material would be better while assembling the car
4.  An option to manually control using joystick in addition to the automation, to overcome the exceptional situation proactively
5.  Increase the memory of the card so that we can hold more data like bigger datasets, etc.
6.  More reliable power supply
7.  Since running the pi tends to heat the motherboard, better air circulation maybe required
